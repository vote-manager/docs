To add a role reward, simply fill out the options under the heading **Add Reward**. To make the role permanent, leave the **Duration** inputs blank

Once you have finished filling out the options, click on the **Add Reward** button in the bottom right. The role will be added to the **Current Rewards** table. You can now add more roles. Remember to save once you're done!

If you wish to remove a role, then just click on the **X** icon next to the row containing the role reward you wish to remove. It will then be removed from the able and once you press **Save Changes** that role will no longer be given
